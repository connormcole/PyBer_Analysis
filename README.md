# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Presented with PyBer ride share data from multiple cities in rural, urban, and suburban areas, my task was to analyze trends within the data.

## Results

### Summary Dataframe

Above is a pandas dataframe summarizing the results of the analysis. Urban areas had the most amount of rides, drivers, and total revenue, but the highest average fare per ride and per driver were in rural areas. Based on this, rural areas have the biggest growth opportunity - if there were more drivers the revenue would increase. 

### Line Chart Summary

In the above line chart, the three city categories' weekly revenue is plotted from January to the end of April. This again shows how urban cities were the most successful, suburban cities were the next most successful, and rural cities finished at the bottom. 

## Summary
To bridge the revenue gap between the categories, I would recommend the following:
- Hire more drivers for rural cities
- Maintain consistency within urban cities
- Maintain consistency within suburban cities
